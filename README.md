# Algorithms

Just a little sandbox-like repository where I can store algorithms I've been studying or working on.

Mostly consists of algorithms that I've coded from scratch to get better at implementing and understanding.

Also, may hold interesting implementations of algorithms that I've found online that I want to save.
